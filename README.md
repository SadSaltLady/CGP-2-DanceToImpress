How To Play:

Left and Right arrow to move around in a circle. Down arrow to bobble (Dance!)
The goal is to dance for long enough that the female bird is impressed, make sure she has the best viewing angle!

*hint: stay in front of the female bird, and the timer only starts going when the heart is maxed out!*

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
